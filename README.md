Angular 2 Youtube Search Application

The application in the dist directory should run right out of the box if placed on a server.
I did not add a static server to the package.json just for download simplicity.

To install the npm and jspm required packages run:
npm install

Built with :  
Angular 2 beta 16
JSPM
GULP
